Project 1
Problem Statement:
You want to create a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python that takes the input as Rock, Paper, or Scissors and allows you to compete against the computer.
Question:
How can you create a Python program that allows the player to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer?

Project 2
Problem Statement:
You want to implement a Binary Search algorithm in Python to efficiently search for a target value in a sorted list.
Question:
How can I write a Python program that uses the Binary Search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted list?

Project 3
Problem Statement:
You want to write a Python program that can send emails to one or multiple recipients using an email account.
Question:
How can I write a Python program that can send emails to one or multiple recipients using an email account?




Project 4
Problem Statement:
Given the birthdate and name of the person, you want to create a Python program to determine the corresponding Zodiac sign based on the date.
Question:
How can you write a Python program that takes name and birthdate as input and outputs the corresponding Zodiac sign and store it in a file using Pandas?

Project 5
Problem Statement:
Often, we have a large number of files in a directory with names that do not follow a specific pattern or are not easy to understand. Renaming each file manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. To solve this problem, we need a program that can rename a large number of files in bulk, based on a specified pattern.
Question:
Can you develop a Python program that takes a directory path and a pattern as input, and renames all the files in the directory that match the pattern to a new name that follows the specified pattern?

Project 6
Problem Statement:
The task is to scrape the top rated movies data from the IMDB website using Beautiful Soup in Python. The data required to be extracted includes the rank, movie title, release year and IMDB rating.
Question:
What is the process to extract data from the IMDB website using Beautiful Soup in Python? Specifically, how can we extract the rank, movie title, release year and IMDB rating for the top rated movies?
